## Initial Setup

This section specifies the run order and requirements for the initial setup the repository. Other repositories in this organization are reliant upon this setup being completed.

### Persistent System Environment Variables

Immediately after cloning this repository, [create a persistent system environment](https://superuser.com/q/284342/44051) variable titled `AEM_DIR_CORE` with a value of the full path to this repository root directory.

On unix there are many ways to do this, here is an example using [`/etc/profile.d`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/117473). Create a new file `aem-env.sh` using `sudo vi /etc/profile.d/aem-env.sh` and add the command to set the variable:

```bash
export AEM_DIR_CORE=PATH TO /em-core
```

You can confirm `AEM_DIR_CORE` was set in unix by inspecting the output of `env`.

### MINGW Requirements

To run the code within a MINGW environment, a working installation of Perl is required. If Perl is not already installed in your environment (e.g., when using Git Bash for Windows), you can download [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/), install it and add it to your PATH. This step must be done before running the setup script when using MINGW. The `bootstrap.sh` (see below) script will install `xpath` and` Scalar::Util` using Perl's cpan tool.

### Scripts

This is a set of boilerplate scripts describing the [normalized script pattern that GitHub uses in its projects](https://github.blog/2015-06-30-scripts-to-rule-them-all/). The [GitHub Scripts To Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) was used as a template. Refer to the [script directory README](./script/README.md) for more details.

You will need to run these scripts in this order to download dependencies, initialize git submodules, download the default digital elevation models, airspace data, etc.

1. [bootstrap](./script/README.md#scriptbootstrap)
2. [setup](./script/README.md#scriptsetup)

### MATLAB MEX

Compile the [MEX functions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-mex-file-functions.html) detailed in the [MATLAB directory README](./matlab/README.md).

### Process FAA Data

1. Run in MATLAB `RUN_Airspace_1.m` to parse and process the [FAA class airspace definitions](./data/FAA-NASR/README.md)
2. Run in MATLAB `RUN_readfaaacreg.m` to parse and process the [FAA aircraft registry](./data/FAA-AircraftRegistry/README.md)
3. Run in MATLAB `RUN_readfaadof.m` to parse and process the [FAA digital obstacle file](./data/FAA-DOF/README.md)

## Data

Commonly used datasets, refer to the [data directory README](./data/README.md) for more details. Data directories are organized by prefixes.

## Language Specific Directories

Utilities to support specific software. Each programming language (i.e. MATLAB) should have their own dedicated directory.

## Output

Default output directory for RUN scripts and functions.
