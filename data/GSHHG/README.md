# Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG)

According to [NOAA](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/):

> Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG) is a high-resolution geography data set, amalgamated from two databases: World Vector Shorelines (WVS) and CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII). The former is the basis for shorelines while the latter is the basis for lakes, although there are instances where differences in coastline representations necessitated adding WDBII islands to GSHHG. The WDBII source also provides political borders and rivers. GSHHG data have undergone extensive processing and should be free of internal inconsistencies such as erratic points and crossing segments. The shorelines are constructed entirely from hierarchically arranged closed polygons.
