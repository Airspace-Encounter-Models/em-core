# SRTM3

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is an international research effort that obtained digital elevation models on a near-global scale. For the MATLAB utilities, we assume the data is formatted as Defense Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).

SRTM1 and SRTM3 data are available in the DTED format via [mail order]((https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/Documentation/SRTM_Topo.pdf)). [According to the NGA](https://www.nga.mil/ProductsServices/TopographicalTerrestrial/Pages/DigitalTerrainElevationData.aspx), distribution of DTED2 and DTED1 are authorized to the Department of Defense, U.S. DOD contractors, and to U.S. Government agencies that support DOD functions. Through these means, MIT Lincoln Laboratory has 1 and 3 arc-second data in the DTED format, however they are not authorized to release this datasets to the public.

## Download Instructions

The data are available for download from the USGS:
